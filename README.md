# Tube Tracker Widget

Welcome to my Huddled Media tech test repo, in which I built a small React app to use Transport for London's public api. The purpose is to display all statuses of all tube lines on every refresh (or automatically every 60 seconds) of the widget, with the ability to read the details of the status for a given line if required.

## How to run the app
To install the app locally, you will need npm version 6.12.1 and Node version 10.15.2 (or higher respectively) on your machine. When installing Node, npm is installed automatically. Checking to see if either is installed, copy and enter the following command into your terminal:

```bash

node -v

npm -v

```

Provided both are as they need to be, copy and enter the following commands into your terminal to run the app. It might take a minute between commands so give it a chance :)

```bash

git clone https://github.com/smegbot1/huddled-media-tech-test

cd /huddled-media-tech-test

npm install

npm run start

```
> NOTE: It is usually a good idea to have your desired browser already open before the last command. Should you run into any problems with 'npm start', try opening your browser first and then running the command.

Hey presto, you're tube tracker is giving you the latest line statuses!
Once you're done with the app, hit "Ctrl + C" in the terminal from before. Otherwise, the file containing the app is safe to delete whenever you like.

Thanks for checking this out :)
